  "Question: What is the intersection point of the line $y = 2x + 5$ and the line perpendicular to it that passes through the point $(5, 5)$?\n\nThought: To find the intersection point of the line $y = 2x + 5$ and the line perpendicular to it that passes through the point $(5, 5)$, we first need to find the slope of the perpendicular line. Since the slope of the given line is 2, the slope of the line perpendicular to it will be the negative reciprocal, which is $-\\frac{1}{2}$. Then we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to find the equation of the perpendicular line. Now that we have the slope of the perpendicular line, we can use the point $(5, 5)$ and the slope $-\\frac{1}{2}$ to write the equation of the perpendicular line in point-slope form, which is $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $m$ is the slope and $(x_1, y_1)$ is the point the line passes through. With the equation of the perpendicular line in point-slope form, we can then set the two equations equal to each other to find the intersection point. The equation of the perpendicular line is $y - 5 = -\\frac{1}{2}(x - 5)$. We will set this equal to the original line's equation, $y = 2x + 5$, and solve for $x$.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\nline1 = Eq(y, 2*x + 5)\nline2 = Eq(y, -1/2*(x - 5) + 5)\nintersection = solve((line1, line2), (x, y))\nprint(intersection)\n```\n\nObservation: {x: 1.00000000000000, y: 7.00000000000000}\n\nThought: From the result, we can see that the intersection point of the two lines is $(1, 7)$.\n\nFinal Answer: $(1, 7)$\n<Solution complete>",
  "Question: The geometric series $a+ar+ar^2+\\cdots$ has a sum of $12$, and the terms involving odd powers of $r$ have a sum of $5.$ What is $r$?\n\nThought: The sum of an infinite geometric series with first term $a$ and common ratio $r$ (where $|r| < 1$) is given by $S = \\frac{a}{1 - r}$. The sum of the terms involving odd powers of $r$ can be written as a separate series: $a \\cdot r + a \\cdot r^3 + a \\cdot r^5 + \\cdots$, which is also a geometric series with the first term $a \\cdot r$ and common ratio $r^2$. The sum of this series is $S_{\\text{odd}} = \\frac{a \\cdot r}{1 - r^2}$. We are given that $S = 12$ and $S_{\\text{odd}} = 5$. We can set up the following system of equations:\n\n1. $\\frac{a}{1 - r} = 12$\n2. $\\frac{a \\cdot r}{1 - r^2} = 5$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of $a$ and $r$.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\na, r = symbols('a r')\n\n# Define the equations based on the sum of geometric series\neq1 = Eq(a / (1 - r), 12)\neq2 = Eq(a * r / (1 - r**2), 5)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (a, r))\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nObservation: [(24/7, 5/7)]\n\nThought: From the result, we have two possible values for $r$: $r = \\frac{5}{7}$. However, we need to check if this value of $r$ satisfies the condition $|r| < 1$ to ensure it is a valid common ratio for a convergent geometric series. Since $r = \\frac{5}{7}$, and $\\frac{5}{7}$ is less than $1$, it satisfies the condition $|r| < 1$. Therefore, $r = \\frac{5}{7}$ is a valid common ratio for the geometric series.\n\nFinal Answer: $r = \\frac{5}{7}$\n<Solution complete>",
  "Question: Six green balls and four red balls are in a bag.  A ball is taken from the bag, its color recorded, then placed back in the bag.  A second ball is taken and its color recorded.  What is the probability the two balls are the same color?\n\nThought: To find the probability that the two balls are the same color, we can consider the two possible scenarios: both balls are green or both balls are red. We will calculate the probability for each scenario and then add them together to get the total probability.\n\nFor both balls to be green, the probability of drawing a green ball the first time is $\\frac{6}{10}$ (since there are 6 green balls out of a total of 10 balls). Since the ball is replaced, the probability of drawing a green ball the second time is also $\\frac{6}{10}$. The combined probability for both events is the product of the two probabilities.\n\nSimilarly, for both balls to be red, the probability of drawing a red ball the first time is $\\frac{4}{10}$, and the probability of drawing a red ball the second time is also $\\frac{4}{10}$.

The probability that both balls are of the same color is $0.58$. Find $N$.\n\nThought: The probability of drawing two balls of the same color can be calculated by adding the probability of drawing two green balls and the probability of drawing two blue balls. The probability of drawing a green ball from the first urn is $\\frac{4}{10}$ and from the second urn is $\\frac{16}{16+N}$. The probability of drawing a blue ball from the first urn is $\\frac{6}{10}$ and from the second urn is $\\frac{N}{16+N}$.

  "Question: The degree measures of the angles in a convex 18-sided polygon form an increasing arithmetic sequence with integer values. Find the degree measure of the smallest angle.\n\nThought: To determine the degree measure of the smallest angle in an 18-sided polygon, we need to use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is given by the formula $(n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ$. Since the angles form an arithmetic sequence, we can let the smallest angle be $a$ and the common difference be $d$.

To find the exact values, we need to remember that the angles are in integer values. Therefore, $d$ must be a multiple of 2 to ensure that $a$ is an integer.

This number is exactly nine times the product Sarah should have obtained. What is the sum of the two-digit number and the three-digit number?\n\nThought: To solve this problem, we need to establish an equation based on the given information. Let the two-digit number be $x$ and the three-digit number be $y$. According to the problem, the five-digit number formed by placing $x$ to the left of $y$ is $1000x + y$. The actual product Sarah should have obtained is $x \\cdot y$. The relationship between these two numbers is that $1000x + y = 9xy$.\n\nWe need to find integer solutions to this equation where $10 \\leq x \\leq 99$ (since $x$ is a two-digit number) and $100 \\leq y \\leq 999$ (since $y$ is a three-digit number).

Since we know the area, we can solve for $s$ and then calculate the perimeter.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\nfrom sympy import sqrt, simplify\n\n# Given area of the square\narea = 325\n\n# Calculate the side length of the square\nside_length = sqrt(area)\nperimeter = 4 * side_length\n\n# Simplify the expression for the perimeter\nsimplified_perimeter = simplify(perimeter)\nprint(simplified_perimeter)\n```\n\nObservation: 20*sqrt(13)\n\nThought: From the result, we can see that the perimeter of the square is $20\\sqrt{13}$ meters.\n\nFinal Answer: $20\\sqrt{13}$\n<Solution complete>Question: As $x$ ranges over all real numbers, find the range of\n\\[f(x) = \\sin^4 x + \\cos ^2 x.\\]Enter your answer using interval notation.\n\nThought: The function $f(x) = \\sin^4 x + \\cos^2 x$ is a combination of sine and cosine functions. To find the range, we need to understand the behavior of these functions. Since $\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1$ for all $x$, we can rewrite $f(x)$ by replacing $\\cos^2 x$ with $1 - \\sin^2 x$. This will give us a function in terms of $\\sin^2 x$ only, which we can then analyze to find the range.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, sin, cos, simplify\n\nx = symbols('x')\nf_x = sin(x)**4 + cos(x)**2\nf_x_simplified = simplify(f_x)\nprint(f_x_simplified)\n```\n\nObservation: sin(x)**4 + cos(x)**2\n\nThought: The simplification did not change the expression, which means we need to manually replace $\\cos^2 x$ with $1 - \\sin^2 x$ and then simplify the expression again.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, sin, simplify\n\nx = symbols('x')\nf_x = sin(x)**4 + (1 - sin(x)**2)\nf_x_simplified = simplify(f_x)\nprint(f_x_simplified)\n```\n\nObservation: sin(x)**4 - sin(x)**2 + 1\n\nThought: The simplified expression for $f(x)$ is $\\sin^4 x - \\sin^2 x + 1$. To find the range of $f(x)$, we need to find the maximum and minimum values of this expression. Since $\\sin^2 x$ ranges from 0 to 1, we can consider $f(x)$ as a quadratic function in terms of $\\sin^2 x$ with the form $f(u) = u^2 - u + 1$, where $u = \\sin^2 x$. We can find the vertex of this parabola to determine the minimum value of $f(x)$, as it opens upwards (the coefficient of $u^2$ is positive).\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, solve, diff\n\nu = symbols('u')\nf_u = u**2 - u + 1\n\n# Take the derivative of f(u) with respect to u\nf_u_prime = diff(f_u, u)\n\n# Find the critical point by setting the derivative to zero\ncritical_point = solve(f_u_prime, u)\nprint(critical_point)\n\n# Evaluate f(u) at the critical point to find the minimum value\nmin_value = f_u.subs(u, critical_point[0])\nprint(min_value)\n```\n\nObservation: 3/4\n\nThought: The critical point of the function $f(u) = u^2 - u + 1$ is at $u = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the minimum value of $f(u)$ at this point is $\\frac{3}{4}$. Since $f(u)$ is a parabola opening upwards, the minimum value is the lowest value that $f(x)$ can take. The maximum value of $f(x)$ occurs when $\\sin^2 x$ is at its maximum, which is 1. We need to evaluate $f(x)$ at $\\sin^2 x = 1$ to find the maximum value.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\n# Evaluate f(u) at the maximum value of sin^2(x), which is 1\nmax_value = f_u.subs(u, 1)\nprint(max_value)\n```\n\nObservation: 1\n\nThought: The maximum value of the function $f(u) = u^2 - u + 1$ when $u = \\sin^2 x = 1$ is 1. Therefore, the range of $f(x)$ is from the minimum value $\\frac{3}{4}$ to the maximum value 1.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\left[\\frac{3}{4}, 1\\right]$\n<Solution complete>",
  "Question: Let $P$ be a point on the line\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]and let $Q$ be a point on the line\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} + s \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Find the shortest possible distance $PQ.$\n\nThought: The shortest distance between two skew lines can be found using the vector that is perpendicular to both direction vectors of the lines. This vector can be found by taking the cross product of the direction vectors of the two lines. Once we have this perpendicular vector, we can project the vector connecting any two points on the lines onto this perpendicular vector to find the shortest distance.\n\nThe direction vector for line P is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and for line Q is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. We can take any point on line P (for example, when $t=0$) and any point on line Q (for example, when $s=0$) to find the vector connecting these two points.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\nfrom sympy import Matrix\n\n# Define the direction vectors\ndir_vector_P = Matrix([2, -2, 1])\ndir_vector_Q = Matrix([1, 2, -1])\n\n# Calculate the cross product to find the perpendicular vector\nperpendicular_vector = dir_vector_P.cross(dir_vector_Q)\nprint(perpendicular_vector)\n```\n\nObservation: Matrix([[0], [3], [6]])\n\nThought: The perpendicular vector to both direction vectors is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}$. Now, we need to find a vector connecting a point on line P to a point on line Q. We can use the points when $t=0$ and $s=0$ for simplicity. The point on line P is $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ and the point on line Q is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$. We will subtract the point on line Q from the point on line P to get the connecting vector.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\n# Define the points on the lines when t=0 and s=0\npoint_P = Matrix([3, -1, 2])\npoint_Q = Matrix([0, 0, 4])\n\n# Calculate the vector connecting point P to point Q\nconnecting_vector = point_P - point_Q\nprint(connecting_vector)\n```\n\nObservation: Matrix([[3], [-1], [-2]])\n\nThought: The vector connecting point P to point Q is $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. To find the shortest distance between the two lines, we need to project this connecting vector onto the perpendicular vector we found earlier. The formula for the projection of vector $\\mathbf{a}$ onto vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is given by $\\frac{\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}}{||\\mathbf{b}||}$. However, since we are interested in the magnitude of the distance, we will use the formula for the scalar projection which is $\\frac{|\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}|}{||\\mathbf{b}||}$.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\n# Calculate the scalar projection of the connecting vector onto the perpendicular vector\nscalar_projection = abs(connecting_vector.dot(perpendicular_vector)) / perpendicular_vector.norm()\nprint(scalar_projection)\n```\n\nObservation: sqrt(5)\n\nThought: The scalar projection of the connecting vector onto the perpendicular vector is $\\sqrt{5}$. This scalar projection represents the shortest distance between the two skew lines P and Q.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\sqrt{5}$\n<Solution complete>",

Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. We will group the terms with the same power of $x$ and then add their coefficients.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 9*x**9 + 7*x**8 + 4*x**7\npoly2 = x**11 + x**9 + 2*x**7 + 3*x**3 + 5*x + 8\n\n# Simplify the sum of the polynomials\nsimplified_poly = simplify(poly1 + poly2)\nprint(simplified_poly)\n```\n\nObservation: x**11 + 10*x**9 + 7*x**8 + 6*x**7 + 3*x**3 + 5*x + 8\n\nThought: From the result, we can see that the simplified expression of the given polynomial is $x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8$.\n\nFinal Answer: $x^{11} + 10x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8$\n<Solution complete>",
  "Question: Define a $\\it{good\\ word}$ as a sequence of letters that consists only of the letters $A$, $B$, and $C$ --- some of these letters may not appear in the sequence --- and in which $A$ is never immediately followed by $B$, $B$ is never immediately followed by $C$, and $C$ is never immediately followed by $A$. How many seven-letter good words are there?\n\nThought: To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints for a \"good word\" and count the number of valid sequences of seven letters. The constraints are that 'A' cannot be followed by 'B', 'B' cannot be followed by 'C', and 'C' cannot be followed by 'A'. This means that after each letter, we have two choices for the next letter. Since the sequence is seven letters long, we can start with any of the three letters and then have two choices for each subsequent letter.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\n# There are three choices for the first letter\n# For each subsequent letter, there are two choices\n# since it cannot be followed by a specific letter according to the rules.\n\n# Number of good words of length 7\ngood_words_count = 3 * (2 ** 6)\nprint(good_words_count)\n```\n\nObservation: 192\n\nThought: From the result, we can see that there are 192 seven-letter good words that satisfy the given constraints.\n\nFinal Answer: $192$\n<Solution complete>",
  "Question: What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 5, AC=6, BC=7$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\nThought: The radius of the inscribed circle of a triangle (also known as the inradius) can be found using the formula $r = \\frac{A}{s}$, where $A$ is the area of the triangle and $s$ is the semiperimeter of the triangle. The semiperimeter is half the perimeter, so $s = \\frac{AB + AC + BC}{2}$. To find the area $A$, we can use Heron's formula, which is $A = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - AC)(s - BC)}$. Let's calculate the semiperimeter first.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# lengths of the sides of the triangle\nAB = 5\nAC = 6\nBC = 7\n\n# calculate the semiperimeter\ns = (AB + AC + BC) / 2\nprint(s)\n```\n\nObservation: 9.0\n\nThought: The semiperimeter $s$ of the triangle is 9. Now we can use Heron's formula to calculate the area $A$ of the triangle.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\n# calculate the area using Heron's formula\nA = sqrt(s * (s - AB) * (s - AC) * (s - BC))\nprint(A)\n```\n\nObservation: 14.6969384566991\n\nThought: The area $A$ of the triangle is approximately 14.697. Now we can calculate the inradius $r$ using the formula $r = \\frac{A}{s}$.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\n# calculate the inradius\nr = A / s\nprint(r)\n```\n\nObservation: 1.63299316185545\n\nThought: The inradius $r$ of the triangle is approximately 1.633. However, we need to express the answer in simplest radical form. To do this, we should simplify the expression for $r$ without approximating it.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\n# simplify the inradius expression\nr_simplified = simplify(A / s)\nprint(r_simplified)\n```\n\nObservation: 1.63299316185545\n\nThought: It seems that the output for the simplified inradius is still the same as the numerical result. This suggests that the expression is already in its simplest radical form. However, the output is still in decimal form, which is not the simplest radical form we are looking for. We need to ensure that the output is in terms of square roots without decimal approximation. Let's try to express the area and inradius in exact symbolic form again, making sure to avoid any numerical approximation.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\n# Redefine the sides as symbolic variables to avoid numerical approximation\nAB, AC, BC = symbols('AB AC BC')\ns = (AB + AC + BC) / 2\nA_symbolic = sqrt(s * (s - AB) * (s - AC) * (s - BC))\nr_symbolic = A_symbolic / s\n\n# Substitute the actual side lengths\nr_symbolic_simplified = r_symbolic.subs({AB: 5, AC: 6, BC: 7})\nr_symbolic_simplified = simplify(r_symbolic_simplified)\nprint(r_symbolic_simplified)\n```\n\nObservation: 2*sqrt(6)/3\n\nThought: Now we have the inradius $r$ in simplest radical form, which is $\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{3}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{3}$\n<Solution complete>",
  "Question: The graph of \\[y^4 - 4x^4 = 2y^2 - 1\\]is the union of the graphs of two different conic sections. Which two types of conic sections are they?\n\n(Write your answer as a list, with \"C\" for circle, \"E\" for ellipse, \"H\" for hyperbola, and \"P\" for parabola. For example, \"C, H\" if you think the graph consists of a circle and a hyperbola. You may use a letter twice.)\n\nThought: To determine the types of conic sections represented by the given equation, we need to rewrite the equation in a standard form for conic sections. We can do this by completing the square for both $y^2$ and $x^2$ terms.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n# Given equation\neq = Eq(y**4 - 4*x**4, 2*y**2 - 1)\n\n# Move all terms to one side to complete the square\neq_standard = Eq(eq.lhs - eq.rhs, 0)\nprint(eq_standard)\n```\n\nObservation: Eq(-4*x**4 + y**4 - 2*y**2 + 1, 0)\n\nThought: The equation is now in the form $-4x^4 + y^4 - 2y^2 + 1 = 0$. To complete the square, we need to group the $y$ terms and the $x$ terms separately. We can then complete the square for the $y$ terms by adding and subtracting the necessary constant inside the equation. Since there is a $y^4$ term, we expect to complete the square for $y^2$ rather than $y$. Similarly, we will complete the square for $x^2$.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\n# Complete the square for y^2\ny_terms = y**4 - 2*y**2\n# Add and subtract (b/2)^2 where b is the coefficient of y^2 term\nadded_term_y = (2/2)**2\n\n# Complete the square for x^2\nx_terms = -4*x**4\n# Add and subtract (b/2)^2 where b is the coefficient of x^2 term\n# Since there is no x^2 term, we only need to add a term to balance the equation\nadded_term_x = added_term_y / 4\n\n# New equation\neq_balanced = Eq(y_terms + added_term_y - added_term_y + x_terms + added_term_x - added_term_x + 1, 0)\nprint(eq_balanced)\n```\n\nObservation: Eq(-4*x**4 + y**4 - 2*y**2 + 1, 0)\n\nThought: It seems I made a mistake in the previous step. I did not actually complete the square for the $y^2$ and $x^2$ terms. I need to correct this by properly completing the square for $y^2$ and $x^2$ terms. For $y^2$ terms, I need to add and subtract $(\\frac{2}{2})^2 = 1$ to complete the square. For $x^2$ terms, since there is no $x^2$ term, I need to introduce it by adding and subtracting $(\\frac{b}{2})^2$ where $b$ is the coefficient of $x^2$ if it were present. However, since we have $x^4$ instead of $x^2$, we need to factor it out to see if it can be represented as a square of something.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\n# Factor out the y^4 - 2*y^2 term to complete the square\ny_sq_complete = y**2 - 1\n\n# Factor out the -4*x^4 term to see if it can be represented as a square\nx_sq_complete = (-2*x**2)**2\n\n# New equation with completed squares\neq_completed_squares = Eq(y_sq_complete**2 - x_sq_complete, 0)\nprint(eq_completed_squares)\n```\n\nObservation: Eq(-4*x**4 + (y**2 - 1)**2, 0)\n\nThought: The equation is now in the form $(y^2 - 1)^2 - 4x^4 = 0$. This looks like a difference of squares, which can be factored into $(y^2 - 1 - 2x^2)(y^2 - 1 + 2x^2) = 0$. This represents two separate equations: $y^2 - 1 - 2x^2 = 0$ and $y^2 - 1 + 2x^2 = 0$. The first one is a hyperbola because it has a $-x^2$ term, and the second one is an ellipse because it has a $+x^2$ term. Let's factor the equation to confirm this.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\n# Factor the completed squares equation\nfactors = factor(eq_completed_squares.lhs)\nprint(factors)\n```\n\nObservation: NameError: name 'factor' is not defined\n\nThought: There was an error in the previous step because I forgot to import the `factor` function from the `sympy` library. I need to correct this by importing the `factor` function and then factoring the equation.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\nfrom sympy import factor\n\n# Factor the completed squares equation\nfactors = factor(eq_completed_squares.lhs)\nprint(factors)\n```\n\nObservation: -(2*x**2 - y**2 + 1)*(2*x**2 + y**2 - 1)\n\nThought: The factored form of the equation is $-(2x^2 - y^2 + 1)(2x^2 + y^2 - 1) = 0$. This represents two separate equations: $2x^2 - y^2 + 1 = 0$ and $2x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0$. The first one is a hyperbola because it has a $-y^2$ term, and the second one is an ellipse because it has both $x^2$ and $y^2$ terms with the same sign. Therefore, the graph of the given equation is the union of the graphs of a hyperbola and an ellipse.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\text{H, E}$\n<Solution complete>",

Specifically, we can use the fact that if $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$, then $a^k \\equiv b^k \\pmod{m}$ for any integer $k$. Since $13 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$, we can simplify the problem to finding the remainder of $3^{51}$ when divided by 5.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\nremainder = pow(3, 51, 5)\nprint(remainder)\n```\n\nObservation: 2\n\nThought: From the result, we can see that the remainder of $3^{51}$ when divided by 5 is 2. Therefore, the remainder of $13^{51}$ when divided by 5 is also 2.\n\nFinal Answer: $2$\n<Solution complete>",
  "Question: What is the sum of the positive odd divisors of $60$?\n\nThought: To find the sum of the positive odd divisors of 60, we first need to factorize 60 into its prime factors. Then, we can generate all the odd divisors by combining the prime factors, excluding the factor of 2, since including 2 would result in even divisors. Finally, we will sum up all the odd divisors.\n\nAction: python_interpreter\n\nAction Input: ```python\nfrom sympy import divisors\n\n# Get all divisors of 60\nall_divisors = divisors(60)\n# Filter out the even divisors to get only the odd ones\nodd_divisors = [d for d in all_divisors if d % 2 != 0]\nprint(odd_divisors)\n```\n\nObservation: [1, 3, 5, 15]\n\nThought: We have the list of odd divisors of 60, which are [1, 3, 5, 15].
