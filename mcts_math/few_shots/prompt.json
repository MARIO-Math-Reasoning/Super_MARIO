You have access to the following tool:\n\n{tool_desc}\n\n!!!Remember:\n1. When solving math problem, you should think step by step, where each step includes 4 mini-steps Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation. \n2. If some step requires accurate calculation (including but not limited to numerical calculation and symbolic deduction), you should write Python code and execute for accurate result. \n3. The most related Python packages include `math`, `sympy`, `scipy` and `numpy`. \n4. Please use the following template.\n\nQuestion: the input question\n\nThought: the text analysis, and list the math equations if necessary\n\nAction: the action to take, should be `{tool_names}`, or None\n\nAction Input: the Python Code in markdown format (if Action is None, it is None), e.g.,\n```python\nimport math\ntheta = math.pi / 4\nsome_var = math.cos(theta)\nprint(some_var)\n```\n\nObservation: the result of the action\n\n... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)\n\nThought: the final analysis of the answer\n\nFinal Answer: the concise answer without verbose context\n<Solution complete>",
