# Super MARIO: process Supervision without process for MAth Reasoning with code Interpreter Output

Code will be released soon. Stay tuned.

This is the official repo for paper [AlphaMath Almost Zero: process Supervision without process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03553). Our approach involves training the policy and value models using only the mathematical reasoning derived from the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework, eliminating the need for GPT-4 or human annotations.
